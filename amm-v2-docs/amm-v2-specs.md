# Minswap AMM V2 Specification

## 1. Overview

- Minswap AMM V2 uses Constant Product Formula (x * y = k). This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pairâ€™s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.
- The AMM V2 uses Batching architecture to solve concurrency on Cardano. Each user action will create an "Order" and "Batcher" will look through them and apply them into a "Liquidity Pool". A valid "Batcher" is a wallet which contains Minswap's License Token. Batching transaction is permissioned and only is triggered by "Batcher".

## 2. Architecture

There're 5 contracts in the AMM V2 system:

- Order Contract: represents "User Action", contains necessary funds and is waiting to be applied into a Pool
- Order Batching Contract: verify the representation of Liquidity Pool while spending Order Contract in Batching transaction 
- Pool Contract: a.k.a Liquidity Pool, which holds all User's assets for trading.
- Factory Contract: verify the correctness of Pool Creation. Each Factory UTxO is an element of a Factory `Linked List` 
- Authen Minting Policy: is responsible for creating initial Factory `Linked List`, minting legitimate Factory, Liquidity Pool and Liquidity Pool `Share` Tokens

## 3. Specification

### 3.1 Actors

- User: An entity who wants to interact with Liquidity Pool to deposit/withdraw liquidity or swap. The only requirement of users is that they must not be the same as batcher (because of how we filter UTxOs)
- Batcher: An entity who aggregate order UTxOs from users and match them with liquidity pool UTxO. A batcher must hold a batcher's license token. The license token must not be expired and the expired time must be between current time and Maximum Deadline (to prevent minting license with infinity deadline).
- Admin (aka Minswap team): An entity who has permission to update Liquidity Pool's fee, withdraw fee sharing and change the pool's stake address. An Admin must hold admin's license token.

### 3.2 Tokens

- Factory NFT Token: the Factory legitimate Token, can be only minted in Pool Creation Transaction and cannot be outside Factory Contract. The minting must be followed by rule of `Authen Minting Policy`
  - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
  - TokenName: Defined in `Authen Minting Policy` parameters (e.g. "MS")
- Pool NFT token: the Pool legitimate Token, can be only minted in Pool Creation Transaction and cannot be outside Pool Contract. The minting must be followed by rule of `Authen Minting Policy`
  - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
  - TokenName: Defined in `Authen Minting Policy` parameters (e.g. "MSP")
- LP token: Represents Liquidity Provider's share of pool. Each pool has different LP token.
  - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
  - TokenName: Hash of Pool's Asset A and Asset B (`SHA_256(SHA_256(AssetA), SHA_256(AssetB))`) 
- Batcher license token: Permit batcher to apply pool
  - CurrencySymbol: Defined in Pool parameters. The policy is managed by team (e.g. multisig policy)
  - TokenName: POSIX timestamp represents license deadline
- Admin license token:
  - CurrencySymbol: Defined in Pool parameters. The policy is managed by team (e.g. multisig policy)
  - TokenName: A constant string defined in pool parameters (e.g. "ADMIN")

### 3.3 Smart Contract

#### 3.3.2 Order Validator

Order validator is responsible for holding "User Requests" funds and details about what users want to do with the liquidity pool. An order can only be applied to the liquidity pool by Batcher or cancelled by User's payment signature / Script Owner Representation (in case Owner is a Smart Contract)

Each Factory UTxO is an element of Factory `Linked List`, contains a head and tail which are existing Pool's LP Asset Token Name except `#"00"` and `#"ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff00"` aka intial head and tail

The Linked List structure is
(`#"00"`, tail 0)
