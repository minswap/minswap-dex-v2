# Minswap AMM V2 Specification


## 1. Overview


- Minswap AMM V2 uses Constant Product Formula (x * y = k). This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pairâ€™s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.
- The AMM V2 uses Batching architecture to solve concurrency on Cardano. Each user action will create an "Order" and "Batcher" will look through them and apply them into a "Liquidity Pool". A valid "Batcher" is a wallet which contains Minswap's License Token. Batching transaction is permissioned and only is triggered by "Batcher".


## 2. Architecture
![Architecture](pics/architecture.png)

There're 5 contracts in the AMM V2 system:


- Order Contract: represents "User Action", contains necessary funds and is waiting to be applied into a Pool
- Order Spending Contract: takes resposibility to verify two Order contract's redeemer
- Pool Contract: a.k.a Liquidity Pool, which holds all User's assets for trading.
- Factory Contract: verify the correctness of Pool Creation. Each Factory UTxO is an element of a Factory `Linked List`
- Authen Minting Policy: is responsible for creating initial Factory `Linked List`, minting legitimate Factory, Liquidity Pool and Liquidity Pool `Share` Tokens


## 3. Specification


### 3.1 Actors


- User: An entity who wants to interact with Liquidity Pool to deposit/withdraw liquidity or swap. The only requirement of users is that they must not be the same as batcher (because of how we filter UTxOs)
- Batcher: An entity who aggregate order UTxOs from users and match them with liquidity pool UTxO. A batcher must hold a batcher's license token. The license token must not be expired and the expired time must be between current time and Maximum Deadline (to prevent minting license with infinity deadline).
- Custom Pool creator: An entity who has permission to create a Liquidity Pool with custom pool's base fee within allowed range (0.05% to 20%). The creator must hold an Custom Pool Creator's license token
- Pool Fee updater: An entity who has permission to create a Liquidity Pool's base fee and fee sharing to any value within allowed range (0.05% to 20% for base fee and 16.66% to 50% for fee sharing). The updater must hold an Pool Fee Updater's license token
- Fee Sharing taker: An entity who has permission to withdraw Liquidity Pool's fee sharing. The taker must hold an Fee Sharing taker's license token
- Pool Stake Key Updater:  An entity who has permission to update Liquidity Pool's stake credential. The updater must hold an Pool Stake Key Updater's license token
- Pool Dynamic Fee updater: An entity who has permission to enable or disable Liquidity Pool's dynamic fee. The updater must hold an Pool Dynamic Fee Updater's license token


### 3.2 Tokens


- Factory NFT Token: the Factory legitimate Token, can be only minted in Pool Creation Transaction and cannot be outside Factory Contract. The minting must be followed by rule of `Authen Minting Policy`
   - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
   - TokenName: Defined in `Authen Minting Policy` parameters (e.g. "MS")

### 3.4.3 Create Order


Create Order transaction will transfer User funds into an Order UTxO.
