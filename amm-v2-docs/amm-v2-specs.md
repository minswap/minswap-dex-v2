# Minswap AMM V2 Specification


## 1. Overview


- Minswap AMM V2 uses Constant Product Formula (x * y = k). This formula, most simply expressed as x * y = k, states that trades must not change the product (k) of a pairâ€™s reserve balances (x and y). Because k remains unchanged from the reference frame of a trade, it is often referred to as the invariant. This formula has the desirable property that larger trades (relative to reserves) execute at exponentially worse rates than smaller ones.
- The AMM V2 uses Batching architecture to solve concurrency on Cardano. Each user action will create an "Order" and "Batcher" will look through them and apply them into a "Liquidity Pool". A valid "Batcher" is a wallet which contains Minswap's License Token. Batching transaction is permissioned and only is triggered by "Batcher".


## 2. Architecture
![Architecture](pics/architecture.png)

There're 5 contracts in the AMM V2 system:


- Order Contract: represents "User Action", contains necessary funds and is waiting to be applied into a Pool
- Order Spending Contract: takes resposibility to verify two Order contract's redeemer
- Pool Contract: a.k.a Liquidity Pool, which holds all User's assets for trading.
- Factory Contract: verify the correctness of Pool Creation. Each Factory UTxO is an element of a Factory `Linked List`
- Authen Minting Policy: is responsible for creating initial Factory `Linked List`, minting legitimate Factory, Liquidity Pool and Liquidity Pool `Share` Tokens


## 3. Specification


### 3.1 Actors


- User: An entity who wants to interact with Liquidity Pool to deposit/withdraw liquidity or swap. The only requirement of users is that they must not be the same as batcher (because of how we filter UTxOs)
- Batcher: An entity who aggregate order UTxOs from users and match them with liquidity pool UTxO. A batcher must hold a batcher's license token. The license token must not be expired and the expired time must be between current time and Maximum Deadline (to prevent minting license with infinity deadline).
- Admin (aka Minswap team): An entity who has permission to update Liquidity Pool's fee, withdraw fee sharing and change the pool's stake address. An Admin must hold an admin's license token.


### 3.2 Tokens


- Factory NFT Token: the Factory legitimate Token, can be only minted in Pool Creation Transaction and cannot be outside Factory Contract. The minting must be followed by rule of `Authen Minting Policy`
   - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
   - TokenName: Defined in `Authen Minting Policy` parameters (e.g. "MS")
- Pool NFT token: the Pool legitimate Token, can be only minted in Pool Creation Transaction and cannot be outside Pool Contract. The minting must be followed by rule of `Authen Minting Policy`
   - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
   - TokenName: Defined in `Authen Minting Policy` parameters (e.g. "MSP")
- LP token: Represents Liquidity Provider's share of pool. Each pool has a different LP token.
   - CurrencySymbol: Authen Minting Policy
   - TokenName: Hash of Pool's Asset A and Asset B (`SHA_256(SHA_256(AssetA), SHA_256(AssetB))`)
- Batcher license token: Permit batcher to apply pool
   - CurrencySymbol: Defined in Pool parameters. The policy is managed by team (e.g. multisig policy)
   - TokenName: POSIX timestamp represents license deadline
- Admin license token:
   - CurrencySymbol: Defined in Pool parameters. The policy is managed by team (e.g. multisig policy)
   - TokenName: A constant string defined in pool parameters (e.g. "ADMIN")


### 3.3 Smart Contract


#### 3.3.1 Order Spending Validator


Order Spending validator is a Withdrawal Script and takes the responsibility to validate two Order contract's redeemer *ApplyOrder* and *CancelExpiredOrderByAnyone*.
To avoid overlapping validation in each utxo, we forward these conditions to this script and the Order script will rely on it

#### 3.3.1.1 Parameter


- _pool_hash_: the hash of Liquidity Pool Script


#### 3.3.1.2 Redeemer


- **OrderSpendingRedeemer**:
 - _pool_input_index_: Index of Pool UTxO in Transaction Inputs.


#### 3.3.1.3 Validation


- **OrderBatchingRedeemer**: The redeemer contains `pool_input_index`, it's used for finding Pool Input faster
  - In case the inputs at *pool_input_index* is Pool Input (Address's Payment Credential matching with `pool_hash`), the contract is passed and forward the validation to Pool Contract
  - Otherwise, it trigger validation for cancelling expired order:
    - this flow will assume all script inputs are orders and must have the Order datum structure
    - each input must be matched with an output in the same index
    - validate the transaction must be created after expired time
    - validate ADA in the order might be deducted for tipping a canceller. The tip must not exceed the maximum tip and other tokens must be returned to sender
    - If sender is script address, the output have to attach the defined datum


#### 3.3.2 Order Validator


Order validator is responsible for holding "User Requests" funds and details about what users want to do with the liquidity pool. An order can only be applied to the liquidity pool by Batcher or cancelled by User's payment signature / Script Owner Representation (in case Owner is a Smart Contract)


#### 3.3.2.1 Parameter


- _stake_credential_: the Stake Credential of `Order Spending Validator`
